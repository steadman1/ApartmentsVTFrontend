# More about our product, "Subleasing VT:"
Inspiration
Finding a dedicated subleasing platform can be challenging, often pushing people to rely on social media. Our platform fills this gap by offering a streamlined way to search for subleases that meet specific needs.

# What it does
Our platform allows users to create, manage, and search sublease listings. With AI technology, users can input their preferences, and the system tailors results to best match their requirements and interests.
